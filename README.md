# A Toy App

One might expect a toy app to do something fun, but this one was more about learning some fun stuff in the midst of making it. The app itself is a free-for-all of user creation and destruction. 

This app used scaffolding generated by Rails, which was useful in this instance but probably not the best choice in real life, since you can't validate or authenticate anything. 

I was also introduced to the Model/View/Controller concept and am glad this first introduction was a fairly simple pattern. 

Essentially, play with this app if you like making up silly usernames.
